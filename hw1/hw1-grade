Problem1:
Design -3 -> Duplicate code. Wrote two for loops to read two lists instead of one function to return a list. 
Also, the "twos" variable in line 27 contains the answer you want. Creating another "intersection" variable to copy over those values
is extra work.

Problem4:
Completeness -2 -> running with "go run problem4.go" and no flag or file specified gives runtime error instead of printing usage statement.
