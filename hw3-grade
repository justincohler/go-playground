-3: I don't believe this works. First, I think your while loop is missing
the key condition of "âˆƒk flag[k]". Without this, I don't think any thread
can lock the lock. Consider one thread trying to lock this lock. It will
set flag[1] = 1 and label[1] = 1. If nothing else happens,
(label[i],i) > (label[k],k) is always true as everything else in the label
array is 0. Also, I think you want to be indexing into flag and label with
tid's instead of i.

-2: Your EBlock doesn't sleep for delay time and instead sleeps for 2ms only.
(Perhaps a typo?)

Comment: please use relative paths for your imports in future, since your
absolute path != my absolute path for you files
